   * The service ranking is used by the Framework to determine the <i>natural

   * <p>
   * The default ranking is zero (0). A service with a ranking of
   * <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> is very likely to be returned as the
   * default service, whereas a service with a ranking of
   * <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> is very unlikely to be returned.

   * <p>
   * If the supplied property value is not of type <code>Integer</code>, it is
   * deemed to have a ranking value of zero.
   * 
   * <p>
   * Hk2 manages its meta information as String, but converts to Integer
   * for comparisons.
